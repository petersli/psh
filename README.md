# psh üêö

Hello! This is a shell written in C. 

psh began its life as a project in Brown's Computer Systems (CS33) course, and the bottom of this README has some next steps outlined. Further features will be added as I conduct more user research and interviews on painpoints with current shells! üòÅ


## Features
**Built-in Commands:**


`cd`: change directory


`ln`: create hard link


`rm`: remove file


`fg`: resume job if suspended, run in foreground


`bg`: resume job if suspended, run in background


`exit`: quit the shell


`jobs`: lists all current jobs and their job ID, state (running/suspended), and the command used to execute them

**Forking Child Processes, I/O Redirection, Background Processes:**


The shell can `fork` and `execv` new child processes based on command line input. To run a process in the background, append `&` to your command. To redirect input, use `<`. To redirect output, use `>` to overwrite the output file or `>>` to append to it,

Examples:


 `psh: /bin/ls ` will print the directory contents


 `psh: sleep 40 &` will sleep for 40 seconds in the background


 `psh: /bin/echo hello > echoed.txt` will overwrite the contents of echoed.txt with "hello"

**Signal Handling:**


The shell responds to user signals as expected, only quitting when it reaches EOF (`CTRL-D`) or the user quits via `exit`. For instance, typing `CTRL-C` will terminate the shell's foreground child process via `SIGINT`.




## How to compile

 *Note: these executables require GNU/Linux to run. For a simple way (< 30 min.) to set up an Ubuntu VM, follow this [guide](http://cs.brown.edu/courses/csci1310/2020/assign/labs/lab0.html), using this [Vagrantfile](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brown-cs0330/student-files/master/Vagrantfile)*

To compile the shell executable normally, run:

  

`$ make 33sh`

  

To compile the shell such that it doesn't print a prompt, run:

  

`$ make 33noprompt`

  

To delete old executables and compile both 33sh and 33noprompt, run:

  

`$ make clean all`




## Code structure

  

`parse()`

This function extracts tokens from the buffer using strtok and parses file redirection symbols and targets. `parse` handles errors that could stem from user input relating to file redirection (trying to redirect output twice, etc). Sets argv appropriately.

`handle_fg_process()`

This function handles waiting, signalling, and reaping of foreground processes. Passes terminal control to child process, then calls waitpid to
wait for the process to finish. Checks status for terminating or suspending
signals, and take appropriate action.

 `exec_child()`
 

This function contains all the logic for the child process. If in child process, sets child pgid, restores signal handlers, and does file redirection. Calls execv. If in parent process, does nothing.

`reap_jobs()`

This function handles "reaping", updating the jobs list to reflect any changes in state (exited, terminated, suspended, or resumed) and ensuring that no zombie processes persist. It calls `waitpid` on all jobs in job list, printing and updating job list as needed.

`main()`:

A do-while loop continues until `exit` is called or `read` receives EOF (`CRTL-D`).

At the start of each iteration, the program calls `reap_jobs` and prints the prompt (if applicable). It then resets the buffer and other global variables, and reads input from the user. The program then calls `parse` and checks for non-white-space input. If there is valid input, the program looks for built-in commands, then executes system calls, send signals, and/or updates the job list as needed. If no built-in commands are found, it will attempt to `fork` a new child process, calling `exec_child` to handle I/O redirection. If the process is running in the foreground, the program calls `handle_fg_process` on the child process. 

All jobs are terminated upon receiving EOF.
  
 
### File Redirection

  

Redirection logic is encoded in these global variables, which are set by the `parse` function and reset to `NULL` each iteration.

```

int input_redirect_code;

int output_redirect_code;

char* input_file;

char* output_file;

```

  
  

### Prompt

When compiled with prompt, the prompt contains your current work directory,

making `cd` and other commands easier to use.

  

Example prompt:

  

`psh: /vagrant/psh-src$`

## Moving Forward (Features to Add)

Shell features
- Smart autocomplete and autocorrect
- Make copy-paste in vim go to system clipboard, especially over ssh

Potential features for a new terminal
- Click to move cursor
- Chat / real-time collaboration


## Credits

CS33's shell assignments did not provide starter code, but they did provide the functionality specifications that guided my initial engineering.
The one exception is the `jobs list` data structure, which was given via `jobs.c` and `jobs.h`.
